AleBoards
=========

Reimplementation of Dogfish Head Alehouse's [Aleboards](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aleboards/id299206419?mt=8&at=10l73r) app. DFH never updated the app for the iPhone 5's larger screen, or more recently, for iOS 7. This version supports both, as well as additional features like Dynamic Type, custom fonts, Google Maps, and more.

The behavior is nearly identical to the original app. Swipe between the different locations.
